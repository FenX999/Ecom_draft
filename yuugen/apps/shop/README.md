# The shop application

The acces of the shop is available to everyone and doesn't need login to navigate, registration are needed only in the case of a purchase or by the user's choice.

Tags are used for the navigation of the store and are linked into all product.

Basicaly the relation run as grand parent (theme tag) shown at the index of the store => parents ( catalog tag ) will manage a product list => and the child ( the product ) shown as a product page.

exemple :

_Theme tag_ could cover wich saison an appareil store would want to principally categorized their products.
appear at the home page and is the first choice a visitor make to go throught his journey 

_Catalog tag_ could cover the type of product should be dress for winter and for summer.
displayed as a list once a theme is choosed by clicking on a catalog tag you will have a list of product shown to you.

_Operation tag_ are used to deal with solds, discount and special operation ( ex Black Friday ) to deal and manage a specified discount.

this way by simply adding product unto the projects you already deal with the filtering and navigation 

really simple an solid solution to build a scalable ecommerce without to many code to write.
